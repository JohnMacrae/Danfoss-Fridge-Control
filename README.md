# Danfoss-Fridge-Control

I have a Danfoss BD35 and BD50 compressor running the fridge and freezer on my boat. This project has been brewing since I sopke with a friend, Rick, back in 2016 but although I tinkered with it, I didn't get serious - mostly due to lack of confidence born out of lack of competence :)
While we were on board in 2019, however, the mechanical thermostat on the fridge (BD35) broke and I was forced to 'create' something out of what was on board  - an ESP8266, a DS18b20 and a chinesium relay.

It was successful and ran for months without any problems but as you can see it was a bit of a bodge.  So, I decided to make a board and run it on an ESP32.
